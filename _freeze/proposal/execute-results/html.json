Manufacturing equipment continuously monitors various parameters, such as temperatures, vibrations, motor speeds, and energy consumption, using sensors and other methods. Variations in these parameters can indicate shifts in performance, potentially leading to defects or catastrophic failures in the equipment. Detecting these shifts has become increasingly important to reduce downtime and boost productivity.\n\nAdvanced techniques such as machine learning, anomaly detection, and image analysis are currently being utilized to forecast when equipment might require maintenance, calibration, or material changes. This project aims to leverage synthetic public data from Kaggle to compare various classification and regression models, with the objective of predicting these critical events. If time allows, we will also explore anomaly detection techniques on time series data to predict potential failures as early as possible.\n\n## **Proposed Datasets:**\n\n1.  Source: Kaggle - [Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification) (Synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry)\n\n2.  Source: Kaggle - [Intelligent Manufacturing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/intelligent-manufacturing-dataset/data) (The Intelligent Manufacturing Dataset for Predictive Optimization is a dataset designed for research in smart manufacturing, AI-driven process optimization, and predictive maintenance)\n\n\n## **Project Schedule**\n\nWeek 1.\n\n-   Definition of problem statement and goals\n\n-   Plan to incorporate peer review feedback into project plan\n\n-   Data cleaning. (handling missing, outliers, define imputation methods).\n\n-   Define key response on the datasets, depending on the model (might want to look like defects pass/fail) for a classification model or defect rate for a regression model. \n\nWeek 2. \n\n-   Analyze features (use PCA or others to understand which features contribute more the variability, etc.)\n\n-   Classification Model Creation and Validation\n\n-   Regression Model Creation and Validation\n\n-   Comparing models and recommend the best one. \n\nWeek 3:\n\n-   Assess anomaly detection and recommend future possible next steps. \n\n-   Prepare final Report and Presentation\n\n## **Project Organization.**\n\n-   Describe Git Repo\n\n",
