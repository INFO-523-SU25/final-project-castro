    "text": "🎯Goals:\nThe construction of modern factories is resulting in the generation of vast amounts of data. Manufacturing equipment continuously monitors various parameters, such as temperatures, vibrations, motor speeds, and energy consumption, using sensors and other methods. Variations in these parameters can indicate shifts in performance, potentially leading to defects or catastrophic failures in the equipment. Detecting these shifts has become increasingly important to reduce downtime and boost productivity.\nAdvanced techniques such as machine learning, anomaly detection, and image analysis are currently being utilized to forecast when equipment might require maintenance, calibration, or material changes. This project aims to leverage synthetic public data from Kaggle to compare various classification and regression models, with the objective of predicting these critical events. If time allows, we will also explore anomaly detection techniques on time series data to predict potential failures as early as possible."
